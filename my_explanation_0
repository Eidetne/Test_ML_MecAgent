1. Understanding the exercise :

Goal Of the project : 

I tasked with building a machine learning model that does :

    Input : a rendred image with of 3D model
    Output : The CadQuery script that generates that 3D model

This is a multi-modal learning task:

    Image â†’ sequence of structured tokens (code)
    Output needs precise syntax, not vague summaries

our model must:

    Understand 3D shapes from 2D images
    Learn the syntax and logic of CadQuery
    Translate vision into code

2. Data Structure

I am given:

147,000 image/code pairs

Each pair looks like:

    Image file "box001.png"

    CadQuery code "cq.Workplane('XY').box(1,2,3)"


I am going to do a Fine-tuning
